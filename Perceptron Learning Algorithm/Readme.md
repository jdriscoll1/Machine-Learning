This programming assignment is for you to finish the code for the `PLA` class in the `pla.py` file. Please go to that file and see the instructions there. 

You only need to submit that `pla.py` file. We (the TA and myself) will use our own main module and data to test your `PLA` class. 

You feel free to create your own main module and data sets for testing. Please know the class `PLA` does not assume any particular value for $N$ (the training sample set size), and does not assume any particular value for $d$ (the number of features in each sample). In other words, your code shall be working for any $N\geq 1$ and any $d\geq 1$. 

Enclosed is another file `handy_plot.ipynb`. This file has a few cells that show you how to plot dots, equations, lines, etc., using ``matplotlib``. This is only for your convenience in case you want plot your own data and the found cutting line, for visualization or simply for amusement. Please know that you have no way to plot high-dimensional data. Feel free to research for various ways to do data plotting.
